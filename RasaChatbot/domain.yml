  utter_whentobuy:
  - text: You should buy auto insurance before you begin driving, as itâ€™s required
      in most states (see below). Driving without insurance is often illegal and leaves
      you financially vulnerable.
  - text: If you already have the insurance, you should buy it once it gets expired
  utter_mandatory:
  - text: In most states, soAme level of car insurance is required. The minimum amount
      of coverage may just be liability insurance, or it may include uninsured/underinsured
      motorist or additional medical coverage.  New Hampshire and Virginia do not
      require that drivers buy auto insurance, but do have minimums in place for drivers
      who do choose to buy insurance. You can find out how much auto insurance is
      required in your state here.
  - text: Yes, the car insurance is mandatory
  utter_wheretobuy:
  - text: There are many national and local insurance companies that offer car insurance.
      Many of these insurers sell other insurance products as well, and may offer
      discounted rates to policyholders who buy multiple policies from them (see below
      for more information on car insurance discounts).  Drivers can buy car insurance
      from individual insurance agents or companies, or from a broker that offers
      insurance from many different companies. Drivers can save money by comparing
      auto insurance quotes and making sure that they get the best deal possible on
      the coverage they need.

  utter_insurancecost:
  - text: 'Car insurance rates depend on a number of factors. These include:  Personal
      details like age, sex, and marital status Where you live Average annual distance
      driven Your vehicle Your credit Your coverage amount and type According to the
      Insurance Information Institute, the average annual car insurance cost was around
      $866 dollars in 2014.'

  utter_effect_insurance_rates:
  - text: Yes. The market value of your car and the history of other drivers with
      the same make and model play a factor in your auto insurance rates. Certain
      safety features may not automatically qualify you for cheaper car insurance,
      but they can prevent you from getting into accidents, saving you money indirectly.
